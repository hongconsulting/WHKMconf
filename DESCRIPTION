Description: This package re-implements selected pointwise confidence intervals 
    and simultaneous confidence bands for Kaplan-Meier survival estimates from 
    the the 'km.ci' package, and from the work of Sachs, Brand, and Gabriel 
    (DOI:10.1038/s41416-022-01920-5). The implementation for Nair confidence 
    bands allows arbitrary confidence levels rather than being restricted to 
    pre-computed tables of critical values. The implementation for 
    Thomas–Grunkemeier confidence intervals maintains numerical stability at 
    extremely small alpha values that may arise during the construction of 
    Hollander–McKeague confidence bands. 'WH' code is designed to maximise 
    speed, for use in simulation studies. As such, input validation is minimal 
    and the user is responsible for ensuring valid use.
