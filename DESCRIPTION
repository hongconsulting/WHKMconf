Description: Re-implements selected pointwise confidence intervals and 
    simultaneous confidence bands for Kaplan-Meier survival estimates from the 
    'km.ci' package and from the work of Sachs, Brand, and Gabriel 
    (DOI:10.1038/s41416-022-01920-5) for improved performance. The 
    Hollander-McKeague confidence band implementation includes an 'adapt' option 
    that automatically shortens the length of the band to prevent excessive 
    width. The Nair confidence band implementation allows arbitrary confidence 
    levels rather than being restricted to pre-computed tables of critical 
    values. The Thomas–Grunkemeier confidence interval implementation maintains 
    numerical stability at extremely small alpha values that may arise during 
    the construction of Hollander–McKeague confidence bands. 'WH' code is 
    designed to maximise speed, for use in simulation studies. As such, input 
    validation is minimal and the user is responsible for ensuring valid use.
